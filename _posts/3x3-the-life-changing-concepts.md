## Introduction

Life is a journey full of twists and turns, ups and downs, and unexpected surprises. It is a journey that is shaped by various factors, including our personal experiences, values, and skills. Throughout my life, I have learned that there are certain skills and philosophies that have significantly influenced and driven my journey. These skills and philosophies have helped me navigate through the complexities of life, overcome obstacles, and pursue my goals with passion and purpose.

As I reflect on my experiences, I realize that these skills and philosophies fall into three key areas: soft skills, hard skills, and philosophy. Soft skills are the intangible qualities that enable us to relate to others, communicate effectively, and adapt to change. Hard skills, on the other hand, are the technical abilities or knowledge that can be learned through education or training. Finally, philosophy refers to the set of beliefs and values that guide our thinking and behavior.

In this blog post, I will delve deeper into these three areas and share with you three facts that have driven my life in each area. These facts have helped me achieve success in my personal and professional life and have kept me motivated and focused on my goals. I hope that by sharing these facts with you, I can inspire you to develop these skills and adopt these philosophies in your own life, and embark on a journey that is fulfilling and rewarding.

## Soft Skills

Soft skills refer to those skills that enable us to navigate the complexities of life effectively. These skills are essential in building relationships, communicating effectively, and overcoming challenges. Three soft skills that have driven my life are a growth mindset, grit, and lifelong learning.

### Growth Mindset

A growth mindset is the belief that we can develop our abilities and intelligence through hard work, dedication, and perseverance. In other words, people with a growth mindset believe that their abilities are not fixed but can be improved with effort and practice. This mindset has helped me overcome obstacles, take risks, and embrace failure as a learning opportunity. Rather than being discouraged by setbacks, I use them as a chance to learn and grow. A growth mindset has also helped me develop a positive attitude towards challenges, and instead of being intimidated by them, I see them as opportunities to develop my skills further.

### Grit

Grit is the ability to persevere in the face of adversity. It is the strength of character that helps us push through challenges and overcome obstacles. People with grit are resilient and persistent, and they stay focused on their goals even when the going gets tough. This skill has enabled me to stay motivated and committed to achieving my goals, even when I faced setbacks or encountered difficulties. Grit has also helped me develop self-discipline and the ability to keep going even when I don't feel like it.

### Lifelong Learning

Lifelong learning is the continuous pursuit of knowledge and skills throughout one's life. It involves being open to new ideas, staying curious, and seeking out opportunities to learn and grow. Lifelong learning has helped me adapt to change and remain relevant in an ever-evolving world. I've learned that the more I know, the more confident I feel, and the more equipped I am to handle challenges. By staying up-to-date with the latest trends, technologies, and best practices, I've been able to stay ahead of the curve in my personal and professional life.

In conclusion, developing soft skills is essential for success in all areas of life. A growth mindset, grit, and lifelong learning are three skills that have driven my life and helped me achieve my goals. By cultivating these skills, we can become more resilient, adaptable, and effective in navigating life's challenges.

Hard skills refer to specific technical abilities or knowledge that can be learned through education or training. Three hard skills that have driven my life are English, computational thinking, and digital literacy.

### English

English is a global language that is widely spoken and used in various fields, including business, science, and technology. Being proficient in English has opened up many opportunities for me, as it has enabled me to communicate effectively with people from different cultures and backgrounds. English proficiency has also helped me access information and resources that are available in English, such as academic research, online courses, and networking opportunities. Moreover, English is a language of diplomacy, and being proficient in it has helped me build bridges between people from different countries and cultures.

### Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a problem-solving skill that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. This skill has helped me approach problems in a logical and structured way, which has been beneficial in both my personal and professional life. Computational thinking has also helped me develop critical thinking skills, as I have learned to analyze problems, identify patterns, and develop algorithms to solve them. This skill has been particularly useful in my work as a data analyst, where I have to process large datasets and extract meaningful insights from them.

### Digital Literacy

Digital literacy is the ability to use digital technologies and tools effectively. This skill has become increasingly important in today's digital age, where almost every aspect of our lives is connected to the internet and digital devices. Being digitally literate has enabled me to work efficiently, collaborate with others remotely, and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends. Moreover, digital literacy has helped me become more independent and self-sufficient, as I can now perform many tasks, such as online banking, shopping, and research, without the need for assistance.

In conclusion, hard skills are critical for success in today's fast-paced, digital world. English, computational thinking, and digital literacy are three hard skills that have driven my life and helped me achieve my goals. By developing these skills, we can become more competitive, adaptable, and valuable in our personal and professional lives.

Philosophy refers to the set of beliefs and values that guide our thinking and behavior. Three philosophies that have driven my life are Ikigai, Hygge, and First principle.

### Ikigai

Ikigai is a Japanese concept that refers to one's reason for being or sense of purpose in life. This philosophy has helped me stay focused on my goals and pursue what I am passionate about. The concept of Ikigai involves finding the intersection between what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. By identifying my Ikigai, I have been able to align my personal and professional goals with my values and passions. This has enabled me to find fulfillment and meaning in my work and personal life.

### Hygge

Hygge is a Danish concept that refers to creating a cozy and comfortable atmosphere. This philosophy has helped me appreciate the simple things in life and find joy in the present moment. Hygge involves creating a warm and welcoming environment that promotes relaxation and comfort. This can be achieved through activities such as reading a book by the fireplace, having a picnic in the park, or spending time with loved ones. By practicing Hygge, I have been able to reduce stress, improve my mood, and foster closer relationships with the people around me.

### First Principle

First principle is a philosophy that involves breaking down complex problems into their fundamental parts and analyzing them from first principles. This philosophy has helped me approach problems creatively and come up with innovative solutions. By deconstructing problems into their most basic elements, I have been able to identify new opportunities and think outside the box. This philosophy has been particularly useful in my work as a researcher, where I have to tackle complex problems and find new ways to approach them. By using first principles thinking, I have been able to make breakthroughs and develop new ideas that have advanced my field.

In conclusion, philosophy is an essential aspect of our lives that can help us find meaning, joy, and creativity.

The ability to zoom in and out is a valuable concept that can be applied to many areas of life, from problem-solving to decision-making. This concept is about being able to shift our focus from the micro to the macro level and vice versa, allowing us to view the world from different perspectives. By zooming in, we can focus on the details and get a more comprehensive understanding of a situation. This is especially important when we need to conduct a rigorous analysis, identify patterns, or troubleshoot a problem.

On the other hand, by zooming out, we can see the big picture and gain a broader perspective on the situation. This helps us to identify trends, patterns, and connections that we may not have seen otherwise. This perspective is essential when making strategic decisions, setting long-term goals, or managing complex projects.

The ability to zoom in and out is a valuable skill that can help us navigate the complexities of life more effectively. When we're stuck with a problem, this concept can help us break it down into smaller, more manageable parts, allowing us to identify the root cause and come up with a solution. Additionally, by zooming in and out, we can better understand the impact of our decisions on both a micro and macro level, which is critical when trying to achieve a desired outcome.

In conclusion, the ability to zoom in and out is a powerful concept that can help us view the world from different perspectives, enabling us to be more effective and efficient in our work. It requires the ability to shift our focus and adapt our thinking to different situations, but with practice, we can develop this skill and apply it to all aspects of our lives.

And there you have it! Three soft skills, three hard skills, three philosophies, and one unique concept to help you view the world from different perspectives. So, the next time you're faced with a challenging problem, remember to zoom in for the details and zoom out for the big picture. And who knows, maybe you'll discover a new solution that you wouldn't have seen before! Keep exploring and growing, and don't forget to have some fun along the way.
